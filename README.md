First find a template and update it based on your needs.
Afterwards, create a repository which starts with your user name and ends with .github.io
then push the files and you are done!

The good part about this github pages is that your co-worker does not have to pull changes to see outcome. 
All it takes is to paste url in the browser search bar.
